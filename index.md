# Robosoft 2022 workshop: *Soft Robotics modeling: what are we missing*?

To model, or not to model? That is a question in soft robotics. Is modeling the way towards next- generation soft robot design, control and best use of embodied intelligence? To what extent can we model the interaction of a soft robot body with the environment and fully grasp the essence of embodied intelligence? Can we achieve digital twins of our soft robots? What is the required relation between accurate modelling and accurate fabrication? How to overcome the reality gap? Those and other questions will be discussed at the workshop. We argue that a wider adoption of computational modeling in soft robotics provides opportunities for progressing towards a model- informed discipline, ultimately responding to societal needs. The challenges involved stand as research opportunities in multiple fields. Transition from prototype-based to model-informed design in soft robotics is within grasp, in an interdisciplinary dialogue that we wish to promote starting with this workshop.
