A modeling lover? Challenge yourself with a modeling problem in soft robotics! 

Please feel free to propose a soft robot of your choice. If you are looking for inspiration, have a look here. 

Also, you are free to use your own modeling tools, but you may wish to give a try to [SoRoSim](https://github.com/Ikhlas-Ben-Hmida/SoRoSim), a ready-to-use toolbox that can make your life easier.

Please submit a presentation of your modeling results via email to: robosoft.modeling@gmail.com. 

Please limit it to a maximum of 3 slides (including possible videos) and please ensure to explain your modeling approach and the techniques used. Any highlights of your model performance will help the jury and participants to select the final winner!

## Deadline: 
April 1st, 2022

You will be invited to present your modeling results at the workshop, in the final session (check [schedule](https://robosoft-modeling.github.io/robosoft-2022-workshop/content/1-schedule.html)), and to compete for the 1st place!
